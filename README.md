[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mtb-tools/language-server-protocol-haxe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mtb-tools/language-server-protocol-haxe)

This is an implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol) in [Haxe](http://haxe.org/).

It's used by the [Haxe Language Server](https://github.com/vshaxe/haxe-languageserver) and was separated from it
so one could implement their own client and/or server using Haxe.

Based on [vscode-languageclient](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node) version 5.2.1.
